I am a Freshman at California State University Fullerton where I am majoring in Electrical Engineering. I am expected to graduate in 2029.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs
Lab 6, Part 2:

  Lab 6, part 2, was my favorite lab because we essentially created a game of Blackjack, which provided insight into potential coding for other games. During this lab, we used vectors for the first time, which was somewhat challenging at first. We also practiced using more complex loops, as Blackjack is a game of chance, and players typically receive different cards; this necessitated the use of if-else statements.  The “if” portion is used if the condition in the “if” statement is true; if the condition is false, it executes the “else” statement. 

Lab 7, Part 1:

  Lab 7, part 1, was my second favorite lab because I think it was a great continuation of Lab 6. Additionally, it was pretty challenging due to the way we had to code based on specific parking signs. In this lab, we used multiple “else” statements within one “if-else” statement. This was due to the multiple parking signs we had to consider and the different days and times we had to be aware of. This use of the “if-else” statement was intimidating at first, but in the end, we saw that the concept wasn’t complicated at all; it was just added steps. 

Lab 8, Part 1 : 

  Lab 8, part 1, was my third favorite lab because we had to incorporate math, since we were coding to calculate an average. In this lab, instead of using the “int” data type, we used the “double” data type. The “double” data type provides a more precise calculation, which is crucial for our situation, given that the average we are calculating is a score for gymnastics. Finally, accuracy is also important in this situation, and the “double” data type provides it.
